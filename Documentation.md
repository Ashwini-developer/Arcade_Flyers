Application Structure
The main application code is located in app.py. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of its components:

Imports: All necessary libraries are imported at the beginning.
Functions:
load_labels(yaml_path): Loads labels from a YAML file.
load_model(model_path): Loads an ONNX model.
preprocess_image(image): Prepares an image for YOLO model processing.
postprocess_detections(preds, input_image_shape, labels): Processes predictions from YOLO.
detect_dents_and_cracks(image, model, labels): Detects structural issues in an image.
vector_embedding(): Handles embedding and vector storage for text analysis.
Main App: The main() function ties everything together and serves the Streamlit UI.
Functionality
Damage Detection
This feature allows users to upload an image of an aircraft structure to check for dents or cracks.

File Upload: Users can upload images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG formats.
Processing: The application utilizes a YOLO model to identify and mark detected damages.
Faulty Wire Detection
This module allows users to input electrical parameters (voltage, current, resistance) to check for faulty wires.

Input Fields: Users can enter the voltage, current, and resistance values.
Prediction: The application uses a pre-trained model to predict wire faults based on the input data.
Fault Bot
This section employs a large language model (LLM) for question answering related to airplane analytics.

User Input: Users can enter queries related to airplane accidents.
Document Embedding: This feature creates a vector store from uploaded documents for context-aware responses.
Response Generation: The LLM generates responses based on user queries and available context.
Using NVIDIA NIM Microservices
The application utilizes NVIDIA NIM microservices for deploying and scaling AI models efficiently.

Dynamic Batching: Implement dynamic batching in the inference logic to optimize model performance.
Model Parallelism: Enable model parallelism to distribute workloads across multiple GPUs for better resource utilization.
Real-Time Monitoring and Auto-Scaling
To ensure optimal performance, consider implementing:

Monitoring Tools: Use tools like Prometheus or Grafana for real-time monitoring of inference requests and resource usage.
Auto-Scaling: Set up auto-scaling rules based on demand to ensure the service remains responsive.
Performance Metrics
To measure the performance of the application, consider tracking:

Inference Latency: Measure the time taken for the model to generate predictions.
Throughput: Calculate the number of requests handled per unit time.
Resource Utilization: Monitor CPU and GPU usage to optimize costs and performance.
Future Improvements
Comprehensive Documentation: Continue to update and expand documentation for user and developer clarity.
User-Friendly Interface: Enhance UI/UX based on user feedback.
Advanced Analytics: Implement additional analytics features for deeper insights.
Security Features: Incorporate authentication and authorization for sensitive data.
Conclusion
This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to the Arcade Flyers application. With its advanced capabilities in structural integrity assessment and electrical fault detection, it aims to enhance safety and reliability in aircraft operations.
